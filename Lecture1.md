## Linear Algebra

### Image Processing
Today's computers are designed to process zeroes and ones. 
An image has multiple attitudes like colour that are to be stored in computer and this is achieved by storing pixel intensities in a construct called matrix and this matrix can be processed to identify colour.

### XGBOOST
It stores numeric data in matrix format.


### Deep Learning (Neural Network)

Employs matrices to store inputs such as all texts or images or speech to give the state of the art solution to the problem that is shown in the figure.
Weights are learnt by neural networks are also stored in matrices.
